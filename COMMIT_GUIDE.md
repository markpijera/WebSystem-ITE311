## Commit Best Practices

### 1. Commit Message Format
```
<type>: <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

**Types**:
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting)
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `test`: Adding tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks
- `security`: Security improvements

### 2. Writing Good Commit Messages
✅ **Good Examples**:
```
feat: Add role-based dashboard with conditional content
fix: Resolve session timeout issue in AuthFilter
security: Implement CSRF protection on all forms
docs: Update README with installation instructions
```

❌ **Bad Examples**:
```
update
fixed stuff
changes
wip
```

### 3. Commit Frequency
- Commit after completing a logical unit of work
- Don't commit broken code
- Commit before major refactoring
- Commit before switching tasks

### 4. What to Commit
✅ **Include**:
- Source code files
- Configuration files
- Documentation
- Database migrations
- Tests

❌ **Exclude** (add to .gitignore):
- `.env` file (contains sensitive data)
- `vendor/` directory
- `writable/` directory (logs, cache)
- IDE configuration files
- OS-specific files (.DS_Store, Thumbs.db)

---

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "fatal: not a git repository"
```bash
# Solution: Initialize git
git init
```

### Issue: "remote origin already exists"
```bash
# Solution: Update remote URL
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/yourusername/ITE311-PIJERA.git
```

### Issue: "failed to push some refs"
```bash
# Solution: Pull first, then push
git pull origin main --rebase
git push origin main
```

### Issue: "Your branch is ahead of 'origin/main'"
```bash
# Solution: Push your commits
git push origin main
```

### Issue: Committed sensitive data
```bash
# Solution: Remove from history (use with caution)
git filter-branch --force --index-filter \
  "git rm --cached --ignore-unmatch .env" \
  --prune-empty --tag-name-filter cat -- --all
```

## Post-Commit Actions

After pushing all commits:

1. **Verify on GitHub**:
   - Check all commits are visible
   - Verify commit messages are correct
   - Ensure all files are present

2. **Create Release Tag** (Optional):
```bash
git tag -a v1.0 -m "RBAC Implementation v1.0"
git push origin v1.0
```

3. **Update README**:
   - Add badges (if applicable)
   - Update installation instructions
   - Add screenshots

4. **Create Pull Request** (if using branches):
   - Write descriptive PR description
   - Link related issues
   - Request code review
